<h3>
<li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
</h3>
<p>
My first thoughts opening the website were about how dated it looks. The vibrant myriad of colors along <br>
with the font and styles do not help with readability. The resolution of the photos looks old and unattractive. <br>
It doesn't feel professional.

</p>

<h3>
<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
</h3>
<p>
The flow of information feels out of order. There are links towards the middle of the page, but none at the top. <br>
The volume of information around the links feels cluttered and confusing.

<h3>
<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
</h3>
<p>
The structure of the main page does not make sense to me. The layout is inconsistent in spacing. I don't agree with<br>
the choice of the site heading and with how much space is used. The hierarchy of information is not well put together, <br>
making the page confusing to navigate. The bottom half of the home page looks like it should be its own page. The <br>
contact links and other links are out of place.

</p>
<h3>
<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it? Why?</li>
</h3>
<p>
The layout is detrimental to the viewer's experience. The spacing is off-putting. There are too many inconsistencies <br>
in the sizes of graphics and headings. The resolution of the photos look dated. The website designer uses the same <br>
photo too many times which becomes a waste of space.
</p>
<h3>
<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
reasonable?</li>
</h3>
<p>
The home page loaded reasonably fast on desktop. The attributes looked like they loaded in different speeds though. <br>
Loading the page on mobile was significantly slower.
</p>
<h3>
<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
</h3>
<p>
The website uses a variety of colors and fonts, which intended to reflect the vibrancy of the content. However, there <br>
were too many inconsistencies with fonts and no unified color palette, which would have helped with readability.
</p>
<h3>
<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
navigation well done?</li>
</h3>
<p>
There was no navigation bar available on the home page, but there were on the other websites linked with this one. <br>
Overall, the navigation on this website makes it difficult to find any desired content.
</p>
<h3>
<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?</li>
</h3>
<p>
The color scheme across the home page and its other linked website pages were inconsistent. One was green, another <br>
was blue, and another one orange.
</p>
<h3>
<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
</h3>
<p>
There is no responsive design on desktop. Changing window sizes does not affect content layout. On mobile, the website <br>
asks you to use landscape mode to view the website. The content does not adapt well to the window size on mobile.

</p>
<h3>
<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
</h3>
<p>
The contents of the page reflect the owner's personality with how vibrant it is with color and her many portrait photos. <br>
You can tell that she loves what she does.
